# cot-4500-intro
In this course, we will be using Python to complete all assignments.

We will also be using Github to upload all assignments that will be in Python files (.py)

For example, in order to run the Intro to Python assignment from the command line, we simply will type such:
python intro_to_python.py

For some of the material, we will be required to use certain packages in Python to answer questions. Also uploaded in this repository, there is a file titled "requirements.txt"

This file will contain the names of all the packages used in the Python files to complete the assignments.

To install the packages labeled in the requirements file, we will type this in the command line:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To output a list of all installed Python modules with their versions, run:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
